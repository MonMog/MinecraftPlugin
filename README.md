# MinecraftPlugin
A plugin where if you break a block, it teleports you about 15 blocks into the air


I have uploaded the .jar for the plugin and will be updating it so you can modify the amount of blocks with a command in chat

Just updated it so that you can set a command to customize the blocks to your liking, the command is "/breakblocks set [number]" where number is how many blocks you would like to be teleported. A negative number can be inputted to result in you being teleported down but only whole numbers can be inputted, no floating points. You need admin powers to use the command. If you encounter any bugs or issues, please let me know
